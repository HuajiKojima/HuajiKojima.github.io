目前就读于宝鸡文理学院软件工程的大学狗一名（因为如果写年级的话，一年就要换一次，麻烦），热衷于计算机图形学，JRPG以及搞些乱七八糟的东西，曾经魔改过RPCS3(家用主机PlayStation3模拟器)项目，只是为了让自己的农企本子跑的起P5的30FPS（但还是没多大效果）。目前正在知识储备ing，为开始自己的第一个图形学开源项目--实时NPR游戏引擎UtopiaEngine做准备。不定期会在此博客更新开发日志以及学习总结与笔记，欢迎各位CG大佬骚扰。以上。

A college student major in BUAS Software Engineering(because if I write grades, it will be changed once a year, and I am a lazy man). I usually research computer graphics and some messy but interesting things(Like how to create this blog use js and html). Last year I joined the RPCS3(PlayStation3 Simulator) project short times, because I want to search the way to let my AMD laptop run fluently of Persona5 (but still not much effect). Currently in the knowledge reserving, in preparation for starting my first CG open source project -- real-time NPR game engine which named UtopiaEngine. From time to time, I will update the development log, study summary and notes into this blog. That's all.

目前就读于某普通二类本科（因为如果写年级的话，一年就要换一次，麻烦）的大学狗一名，热衷于计算机图形学，JRPG以及搞些乱七八糟的东西，曾经魔改过RPCS3项目，只是为了让自己的农企本子跑的起P5的30FPS（但还是没多大效果）。目前正在知识储备ing，为开始自己的第一个开源项目--实时NPR游戏引擎UtopiaEngine做准备。不定期会在此博客更新开发日志以及学习总结与笔记，欢迎各位CG大佬骚扰。以上。

A college student currently studying in an ordinary second-level undergraduate (because if you write grades, it will be changed once a year, and I am a lazy man), loves computer graphics, JRPG and messy things, once magically changed the RPCS3 project, but In order to let my AMD laptop run 30FPS of Persona5 (but still not much effect). Currently in the knowledge reserve ing, in preparation for starting his first open source project -- real-time NPR game engine which named UtopiaEngine. From time to time, I will update the development log, study summary and notes on this blog. That's all.
